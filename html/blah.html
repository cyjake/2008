How Microsoft Conquered China?</h2>

<p class="first">Or is it the other way around? Fortune's David Kirkpatrick goes on the road to
Beijing with Bill Gates, who threw his business model out the window.</p>

<p>By David Kirkpatrick, Fortune senior editor</p>

<p>(Fortune Magazine) &mdash; Mr. Bill Gates! Mr. Bill Gates!&quot; a young woman shrieks as
the black car pulls up. A pallid student in a nylon windbreaker pushes his way
through the security line and hands the world's richest man a small envelope
with a floral design. &quot;It's very important,&quot; he pants.</p>

<p>Another day in China, another round of adulation. Today the Microsoft (Charts,
Fortune 500) chairman is being named an honorary trustee of Peking University.
Yesterday it was an honorary doctorate from Beijing's Tsinghua University - the
13th in the school's 82-year history. Gates, wearing the same lopsided grin he
has had on his face for the past few days, takes the envelope from the young
man. For him this is a triumphant visit to China, a victory lap of sorts, on
which I've been invited to tag along. The country is his.</p>

<p>No other Fortune 500 CEO gets quite the same treatment in China. While most
would count themselves lucky to talk with one of China's top leaders, Gates
will meet with four members of the Politburo on this four-day April trip. As
one government leader put it while introducing Gates at a business conference,
the Microsoft chairman is &quot;bigger in China than any movie star.&quot; Last spring
President Hu Jintao toured the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., and was
feted at a dinner at Gates' home. &quot;You are a friend to the Chinese people, and
I am a friend of Microsoft,&quot; Hu told his host. &quot;Every morning I go to my office
and use your software.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0707/gallery.global500_photos.fortune/index.html">In pictures: Gates goes to China</a></p>

<p>It was not always so. Microsoft bumbled for years after entering China in 1992,
and its business was a disaster there for a decade. It finally figured out that
almost none of the basic precepts that led to its success in the U.S. and
Europe made sense in China. There Microsoft had to become the un-Microsoft -
pricing at rock bottom instead of charging hundreds of dollars for its Windows
operating system and Office applications; abandoning the centerpiece of its
public-policy approach elsewhere, the protection of its intellectual property
at all costs; and closely partnering with the government instead of fighting
it as in the U.S., a stance that has opened the company to criticism from human
rights groups.</p>

<p>&quot;It took Microsoft 15 years and billions of dollars of lost revenue to learn
how to do business in China,&quot; says Sigurd Leung, who follows the company at
research firm Analysys International in Beijing. &quot;We were a naive American
company,&quot; concedes Gates in an interview in his car as he is driven to yet
another meeting with government leaders. &quot;You've got to just keep trying and
trying and trying.&quot; But now, he says, snacking on Pringles and Diet Coke, &quot;we
have a wonderful position in China, and we're going to see great growth every
year for the next five years.&quot;</p>

<p>Gates says he's certain China will eventually be Microsoft's biggest market,
though it may take ten years. Projected sales this year are already three times
what they were in 2004, yet still less than annual revenue in California.
(Microsoft will not disclose figures, but Fortune estimates China revenue will
exceed $700 million in 2007, about 1.5% of global sales.) Now Microsoft even
has its own five-year plan in China, formulated to match up with the
government's. Says Robert Hormats, a longtime China watcher at Goldman Sachs:
&quot;It's a great turnaround story with wonderful lessons for other companies.&quot;</p>


<h2><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
False start</h2>

<p class="first">The story begins 15 years ago, when Microsoft sent a couple of sales managers
into China from Taiwan. Their mission? Sell software at the same prices the
company charged elsewhere. Says Craig Mundie, the top Microsoft executive who
now guides its China strategy: &quot;It was the classic model - hang out a shingle
and say, 'Microsoft: Open for business.'&quot; But the model didn't work.</p>

<p>The problem wasn't brand acceptance; everyone was using Windows. It's just that
no one was paying. Counterfeit copies could be bought on the street for a few
dollars. As Ya-Qin Zhang, who heads Microsoft's Chinese R&amp;D, puts it: &quot;In China
we didn't have problems with market share. The issue is how do we translate
that into revenue.&quot;</p>

<p>Microsoft fought bitterly to protect its intellectual property. It sued
companies for using its software illegally but lost regularly in court. Its
executives, who often disagreed with the strategy, failed in its
implementation. Country managers came and went - five in one five-year period.
Two of them later wrote books criticizing the company. One, Juliet Wu, whose
&quot;Up Against the Wind&quot; became a local bestseller, wrote that Microsoft
heartlessly sought sales by any means, that its antipiracy policy was
needlessly heavy-handed, and that her own efforts to help bosses in Redmond
understand China had been rebuffed.</p>

<p>Then a different form of resistance emerged. Beijing's city government started
installing free open-source Linux operating systems on workers' PCs. (The
Chinese Academy of Sciences promoted a version called Red Flag Linux.)
Meanwhile security officials were troubled that government and military
operations depended on Microsoft software made in the U.S. Could the technology
be spying on China?</p>

<p>In 1999, Gates sent Mundie, who heads the company's public-policy efforts, to
figure out why Microsoft was so reviled. On the trip he had an epiphany: &quot;I
remember going back to Redmond and saying, 'Our business is just broken in
China,'&quot; Mundie recalls. He concluded that the company was assigning executives
too junior and that selling per se was overemphasized. &quot;But where we were most
broken,&quot; he says, &quot;was that our business practices and our engagement did not
reflect the importance of having a collaborative approach with the government.&quot;</p>

<p>Mundie started visiting China four or five times a year. He brought 25 of the
company's 100 vice presidents for a week-long &quot;China Immersion Tour.&quot; He hired
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to advise him and open doors. And he
told leaders that Microsoft wanted to help China develop its own software
industry, an urgent government priority. The company even commissioned a
McKinsey study for Chinese officials in 2001 that, among other things,
recommended improving the protection of intellectual property.</p>

<p>Mundie also began talks with Chinese security officials to convince them that
Microsoft's software was not a secret tool of the U.S. government. As a result,
in 2003 the company offered China and 59 other countries the right to look at
the fundamental source code for its Windows operating system and to substitute
certain portions with their own software - something Microsoft had never
allowed in the past. Now when China uses Windows in President Hu's office, or
for that matter in its missile systems, it can install its own cryptography.</p>

<p>But it was a relatively small step in 1998 - the opening of a research center
in Beijing - that proved a turning point. &quot;We just started it here because we
thought they'd do great research,&quot; says Gates, who raves about the quality of
the country's computer scientists. The lab was what Gates calls a &quot;windfall&quot;
for Microsoft's image. It began accumulating an impressive record of academic
publications, helped lure back smart emigre<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> scientists, and contributed key
components to globally released products like the Vista operating system. The
lab soon became, according to polls, the most desirable place in the country
for computer scientists to work.</p>

<p>By 2001, Microsoft executives were coming to the conclusion that China's weak
IP-enforcement laws meant its usual pricing strategies were doomed to fail.
Gates argued at the time that while it was terrible that people in China
pirated so much software, if they were going to pirate anybody's software
he'd certainly prefer it be Microsoft's.</p>

<p>Today Gates openly concedes that tolerating piracy turned out to be Microsoft's
best long-term strategy. That's why Windows is used on an estimated 90% of
China's 120 million PCs. &quot;It's easier for our software to compete with Linux
when there's piracy than when there's not,&quot; Gates says. &quot;Are you kidding? You
can get the real thing, and you get the same price.&quot; Indeed, in China's back
alleys, Linux often costs more than Windows because it requires more disks.
And Microsoft's own prices have dropped so low it now sells a $3 package of
Windows and Office to students.</p>

<p>In 2003, Mundie and Gates took a quantum leap forward in China by hiring Tim
Chen, who had been running Motorola's China subsidiary. Chen was a superstar,
but when he was hired, articles in the Chinese press asked if he, too, would
fall victim to the Microsoft &quot;curse.&quot;</p>

<p>Chen arrived with entree<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> to the corridors of power and a practiced
understanding of how a Western company could succeed in China. He kept up the
blitz of initiatives. Microsoft made Shanghai a global center to respond to
customer e-mails. It began extensive training programs for teachers and
software entrepreneurs. It worked with the Ministry of Education to finance
100 model computer classrooms in rural areas.</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/07/05/news/international/chinese_lawsuits.fortune/index.htm">China's newest export: lawsuits</a></p>

<p>&quot;So with all this work,&quot; says Chen, &quot;we start changing the perception that
Microsoft is the company coming just to do antipiracy and sue people. We
changed the company's image. We're the company that has the long-term vision.
If a foreign company's strategy matches with the government's development
agenda, the government will support you, even if they don't like you.&quot;</p>

<p>Microsoft put its money on the line, even inviting officials to help decide in
which local software and outsourcing companies it should invest. So far
Microsoft has spent $65 million, and it recently committed to an additional
$100 million. Says Chen: &quot;There was synergy, which we formalized, between the
need of the Chinese economy to have local software capability and our need for
an ecosystem of companies around us using our technology and platform.&quot;</p>

<p>At the same time, the Chinese government started thinking more like Microsoft:
It required central, provincial, and local governments to begin using legal
software. The city of Beijing completed its portion of the project late last
year and now pays for software its employees - most of whom never adopted Linux
- had previously pirated. (Microsoft won't say how steep a discount it offered
the government.)</p>

<p>In another boost for Microsoft, the government last year required local PC
manufacturers to load legal software on their computers. Lenovo, the market
leader, had been shipping as few as 10% of its PCs that way, and even U.S. PC
makers in China were selling many machines &quot;naked.&quot; Another mandate requires
gradual legalization of the millions of computers in state-owned enterprises.
In all, Gates says, the number of new machines shipped with legal software
nationwide has risen from about 20% to more than 40% in the past 18 months.</p>


<h2><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Win-win?</h2>

<p class="first">So did Microsoft conquer China, or is it the other way around? Toward the end
of Gates' trip, on the sidelines of China's Boao Forum, I sat down again with
the Microsoft founder. One of the things I wanted to ask him was how he squares
the company's &quot;alignment&quot; in China with its leaders' suppression of free speech
on the Internet and what many consider to be their general disregard for human
rights. Our conversation, which had been flowing freely, ground to a halt. He
said nothing. His silence lasted so long I found myself piping up out of
discomfort. &quot;That's a very pregnant pause,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't think I want to
give an answer to that,&quot; he finally replied.</p>

<p>Mundie, however, gamely ventured an answer in a separate interview. He started
by talking about the challenges of transforming a socialist planned economy
into one based on the market, and noted that never before have leaders anywhere
attempted such a huge transition. &quot;Whether it's running a global company or a
government,&quot; he says, &quot;people have to sit there and make their own value
judgments against what they deem to be the greater good all the time. I
personally have found the Chinese leaders to be fairly thoughtful about these
things. Each society makes choices to protect the rest of society. There are
some aspects of that that happen here and in other countries that people would
prefer didn't happen. But in the grand scheme of things, they're what people
think is required to keep stability.&quot; When I asked him if he had discussed any
of this with China's leaders, he answered, &quot;No. It's not what they consider to
be my field of expertise. Nor do I.&quot;</p>

<p>This sort of language doesn't impress Sophie Richardson, an Asia expert at
Human Rights Watch. She is distressed that Microsoft shut down the blog of a
government critic on its MSN Spaces service in 2005. (Microsoft set up MSN in
China with a government-owned investment firm.) &quot;We're just not convinced they
have done all they can to push the Chinese government,&quot; says Richardson. &quot;Will
they say no to initiatives in which they might stand to gain financially but
which would oblige them to participate in the repression of rights? I may not
have high expectations of [Chinese search company] Baidu as a defender of free
speech, but I do of Bill Gates.&quot;</p>

<p>Many multinational companies would love to be in Microsoft's shoes. Says Carl
Bass, CEO of Autodesk (Charts), the $2-billion-a-year design-automation
company: &quot;To do business in China you have to work closely with government.&quot;
Sean Maloney, who heads marketing at Intel (Charts, Fortune 500), agrees:
&quot;You can't do too many investments in China that the government doesn't approve
of. You might as well ask them.&quot;</p>

<p>Microsoft's China strategy is clearly paying off. More than 24 million PCs will
be sold this year, adding to the 120 million already in place. Although the
company's China revenues average no more than $7 for every PC in use (compared
with $100 to $200 in developed countries), Gates says those figures will
eventually converge. &quot;What we have here is not about me, and it's not about
where President Hu went to dinner or anything like that,&quot; he says. &quot;It's an
institution-to-institution relationship, where we've really found a win-win
way of doing things together that will generate a substantial part of
Microsoft's growth in the next decade. I don't know any company in the IT
industry where things have worked out as well as they have for Microsoft.&quot;</p>

<p>And not badly for China either.</p>
